# TrafficLights
Small Arduino program that controls a set of traffic lights. There is also an LED board wired up to display messages that correspond with the current active light.

Currently, the entire light cycle lasts 15 seconds. The messages displayed on the LED board are "GO", "SLOW", and "STOP" and are active depending on which traffic light
is turned on.
